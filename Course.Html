        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>As I reflect on my time in Astronomy 101, I'm struck by how much I've learned and how far I've come. At the beginning of the semester, I knew next to nothing about the cosmos. Concepts like stars, galaxies, and the Big Bang theory felt distant and confusing.</p>
        <p>But with each lecture and assignment, things started to click. I went from feeling lost in space to understanding the basics of planetary motion, star formation, and more. By the end of the semester, I could confidently discuss these concepts and appreciate the beauty of the universe.</p>
        <p>Astronomy 101 wasn't just about memorizing facts; it taught me how to think critically and approach problems scientifically. Through hands-on activities and group projects, I gained practical skills and a deeper appreciation for the wonders of the cosmos.</p>
        <p>Overall, this course has been an enlightening journey. While I still have much to learn, I'm grateful for the knowledge and perspective I've gained. I'm excited to continue exploring the mysteries of the universe with newfound curiosity and understanding.</p>
