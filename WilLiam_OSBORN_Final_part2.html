    <h1>Web Development Class Reflection</h1>
    <div class="reflection">
        <h2>Previous Knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript:</h2>
        <p>I had no prior experience with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript before taking this class. It was all new to me.</p>
        
        <h2>Portfolio Creation:</h2>
        <p>I decided to build my portfolio from scratch rather than using a template. While this approach offered more flexibility and customization options, it also presented challenges as I had to learn and implement everything from the ground up.</p>
        
        <h2>Challenges in Portfolio Creation:</h2>
        <p>The most challenging part of creating my portfolio was working with CSS. Understanding how to style elements, manage layouts, and ensure responsiveness across different devices required a lot of trial and error. It was a steep learning curve, but I eventually managed to overcome the challenges through practice and perseverance.</p>
        
        <h2>Impact of Web Development Class:</h2>
        <p>Taking this web development class significantly changed my perspective on the field. It made me realize that web development is not just a hobby but something I can pursue as a career. Learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript opened up a world of possibilities, and I became more confident in my abilities to build websites and web applications.</p>
        
        <h2>Recommendations for Future Students:</h2>
        <p>I would highly recommend future students to embrace the challenges and enjoy the learning process. While the class may be both fun and challenging, it's essential to stay motivated and engaged. Practice regularly, ask questions, seek feedback, and don't be afraid to experiment with different techniques and approaches. Remember that every challenge you face is an opportunity to learn and grow as a web developer.</p>
